O-2. What is a Bootstrap Container, and how does it work?

Ans. 

->>A Bootstrap container is a fundamental layout element that helps structure and organize content. It is used to contain, pad, and sometimes center content, ensuring proper alignment and responsiveness across different screen sizes.


Types of Bootstrap Containers :- 

1. Bootstrap provides three types of containers:

-> .container - Fixed-width container

-> Provides a responsive fixed-width layout.

-> Adjusts its width at different breakpoints (xs, sm, md, lg, xl, xxl).

-> Centered automatically on the page.

Example :- 

    <div class="container">
        <h1>Bootstrap Container</h1>
        <p>This is a fixed-width container.</p>
    <div>

-------------------------------------



2. .container-fluid (Full-width container)

-> Stretches across the full width of the viewport.
 
-> Useful for fluid designs where elements should expand across the screen.


Examole :- 

    <div class="container-fluid">
        <h2>Fluid Container</h2>
        <p>This container stretches to 100% of the viewport width.</p>
    </div>
